### React

The logic is in [index.js](https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048/blob/master/src/helper/index.js). 
There is one main component called [BoardView](https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048/blob/master/src/components/BoardView.jsx) which keeps a Board object as its state. It handles all the events by forwarding them to the Board appropriately, and then propagates the changes to its child components. As promised by React, there is almost no direct DOM manipulation - except for attaching the keyDown listener to ```window``` so the events can be handled on the whole page instead of only when the board is focused.

The [TileView](https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048/blob/master/src/components/Tile.jsx) is where most of the fun view stuff happens. It receives a [Tile](https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048/blob/64a4d34b61229661b4c75b090888fd4331927e81/src/components/Tile.jsx#L19) in its props object and determines whether it is new or moving, and if it's moving - what are the source and the destination. Then it sets the appropriate CSS classes in order to trigger the correct animations.

### CSS Animations

The animations are implemented in SASS. Since there is a separate class for each movement from cell A to cell B, This happens with SASS in [style.scss](https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048/blob/master/src/styles.scss).

### Building and running

To run, simply clone the repo , install dependencies and start a web server serving the main project directory.

    git clone https://github.com/Utqrsh04/Animated-2048.git
    cd Animated-2048
    npm install 
    npm start
    Start Playing & Enjoy ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜Ž

and the game will be accessible on ```localhost:3000```.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
